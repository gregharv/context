# User Profile & Context

## 1. CORE IDENTITY
* **Role:** Senior Data Scientist (Utility Sector, 5+ yrs) & Founder ("Critjecture" Consulting).
* **Location:** Jacksonville, FL.
* **Family:** Married, father of **two young sons**.
* **Key Distinction:**
    * *Employee Role:* Utility Data Science.
    * *Consultant Role:* "Critjecture" (AI/Automation for SMBs).

## 2. COGNITIVE ARCHITECTURE (The "How to Think" Instructions)
* **Philosophy:** Applied Critical Rationalism (Popper, Deutsch, Brett Hall).

* **Heuristic 1 (Epistemology):** **Explanation > Prediction.**
    * Reject "induction" (the idea that the future simply resembles the past).
    * Prioritize "hard-to-vary" explanations.
    * Maintain skepticism of Bayesian credence/probability as a substitute for true knowledge.

* **Heuristic 2 (Learning/Parenting):** **The Fun Criterion.**
    * Fun and interest are the primary error-correcting signals.
    * If a process isn't "fun" (engaging), the method is likely wrong (coercion).

* **Heuristic 3 (Business):** **Wealth = Knowledge.**
    * Consulting is not selling labor/time.
    * Value is created by injecting the *knowledge* required to transform a client's static resources into wealth.

* **Heuristic 4 (Systems & Ethics):** **The Triad of Error Correction.**
    * Views a functional society as relying on three specific mechanisms to correct errors:
    * **1. Free Speech (Information Layer):** Essential not for "expression," but to ensure errors can be *heard* and identified (criticism).
    * **2. Democracy (Political Layer):** Defined strictly as the mechanism for the **peaceful removal** of bad rulers/ideas. Its value is not in "electing the best," but in "removing the worst" without violence.
    * **3. Free Trade (Economic Layer):** The mechanism for **falsifying** bad business models. Consumers "vote" by rejecting bad goods, forcing economic error correction.

## 3. TECHNICAL PREFERENCES
* **Methodology:** **Causal > Predictive.**
    * Prioritize Causal Inference (DoWhy, interventional approaches) over black-box correlations.
    * Focus on the *mechanism* of change rather than simple accuracy metrics.
* **Stack:** Python (Polars/Pandas), FastHTML, HTMX, Quarto.

## 4. DOMAIN INTERESTS
* **Gaming:** League of Legends, Teamfight Tactics (TFT), Poker.
    * *Approach:* Treats games as complex systems to be analyzed/solved.
    * *Constraint:* Acknowledges that for systems like TFT, valid data for Causal ML is often insufficient, requiring reliance on theory and heuristics.
* **Projects:** "Critjecture" (SMB Automation).
